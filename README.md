# VehicleStructure

A Java project for practicing with inheritance and abstraction.

## Description

This repository demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java, specifically focusing on inheritance and abstraction as applied to vehicle structures. It is intended as a learning resource or template for those wishing to understand or teach these foundational OOP concepts.

## Features

- Java classes illustrating inheritance patterns
- Abstract classes and methods for vehicle types
- Simple, easy-to-follow structure for beginners

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer
- A Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) or command line tools

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/knoxdevchris/VehicleStructure.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Explore the Java source files to see examples of:
- Abstract vehicle classes
- Inheritance from base vehicle types to specific vehicles (e.g., Car, Truck, Motorcycle)
- Use of abstract methods
Feel free to modify or extend the classes to deepen your understanding of OOP principles.
